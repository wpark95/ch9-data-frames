# Exercise 2: working with data frames
# Create a vector of 100 employees ("Employee 1", "Employee 2", ... "Employee 100")
# Hint: use the `paste()` function and vector recycling to add a number to the word
# "Employee"
v1 <- 1:100
Employees <- paste("Employee", v1)
# Create a vector of 100 random salaries for the year 2017
# Use the `runif()` function to pick random numbers between 40000 and 50000
Salaries_2017 <- runif(100, min = 40000, max = 50000)
# Create a vector of 100 salaries in 2018 that have changed from 2017
# Use `runif()` to add a random number between -5000 and 10000 to each of 2017's
# salaries (the negative number means that a salary may have decreased!)
Salaries_Change <- runif(100, min = -5000, max = 10000)
New_Salaries_2018 <- Salaries_2017 + Salaries_Change
# Create a data frame 'salaries' by combining the 3 vectors you just made
# Remember to set `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`!

# Create a column 'change' that stores each person's change in salary between
# 2017 and 2018
Salaries$change <- New_Salaries_2018 - Salaries_2017
# Create a column 'got_raise' that is TRUE if the person got a raise (their
# salary went up)
